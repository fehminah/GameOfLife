#Rules to Game of Life
#Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies,
#as if caused by underpopulation

#Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
#Any lvie cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation
#any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
